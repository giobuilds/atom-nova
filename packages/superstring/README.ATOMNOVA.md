# superstring (Chevron fork)

Vendored from `superstring@2.4.4` with a minimal V8 API patch for Electron 14+.

## Patch

`ArrayBuffer::GetContents()` was removed in modern V8 (Electron 14+).
Replaced with `ArrayBuffer::Data()` in `src/bindings/text-buffer-wrapper.cc`.

Prefer `Data()` over `GetBackingStore()->Data()`: Electron's Windows `node.lib` is
built with Chromium's libc++ (`std::__Cr`), so linking `GetBackingStore`'s
`std::shared_ptr` return type fails under MSVC (LNK2001).

## Version

Keep **`version` exactly `2.4.4`** (not a prerelease suffix).  
`text-buffer` depends on `superstring@^2.4.4`; a tag like `2.4.4-chevron.1` does **not** satisfy that range, so npm nests an unpatched copy under `text-buffer/node_modules/superstring` and the build fails again.

Root `package.json` and `package-lock.json` must resolve superstring to `file:packages/superstring`.
