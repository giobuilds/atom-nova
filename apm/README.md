# Historical `apm` tree (Phase 4+)

This directory used to vendor **atom-package-manager** for user package installs and product packaging.

**As of cpm Phases 0–4 (complete):**

- The **product does not ship** this tree.
- User and in-app package management is **`cpm`** (`../cpm/`).
- The **`apm` command name** remains a **shim → cpm** for scripts and muscle memory.
- Monorepo scripts that used to invoke classic apm now use **host npm** or the monorepo **cpm** shim (`script/config.js` → `getApmBinPath()`).

You may still run `./script/bootstrap-modern --with-apm` to install atom-package-manager here for archaeology/debugging. That path is **not** used by packaging or CI.
